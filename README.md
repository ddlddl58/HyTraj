# HyTraj

This python library implements HySPLIT based trajectory modelling and analysis.

# Implemented methods 
1. Trajectory generation (includes parallel implementation script)
2. Trajectory reading and ploting
3. Trajectories clustering (includes k-means clustering with wavelet based features and optimal cluster using elbow method, sspd distance based hierarchical clustering, quick bundle clustering)
4. Backward trajectories based receptor models (includes both single and multi-sites baed weighted and unweighted CWT, PSCF and RWTC)

**Note:** The repository contains scripts implementing the above mentioned methods for Antarctic region at the moment and will be updated very soon with general purpose scripts.
