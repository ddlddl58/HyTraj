abstract = {A variety of scientific and industrial sectors continue to experience exponential growth in their data volumes, and so automatic categorization techniques have become standard tools for dataset exploration. Automatic categorization techniques – typically referred to as clustering – help expose the structure of a dataset. For example, the generated clusters might each correspond to a customer group with reasonably similar needs and behavior. Because the resulting clusters are often used as building blocks for higher-level – often custom – predictive models, researchers have continually tweaked and invented new clustering techniques. PyClustering is an open source data mining library written in Python and C++ that provides a wide range of clustering algorithms and methods, including bio-inspired oscillatory networks. PyClustering is mostly focused on cluster analysis to make it more accessible and understandable for users.},

abstract = {Mass concentration data for PM10 (particulate matter, PM, less than 10 $\mu$m) combined with an air mass back-trajectory clustering technique, a potential source contribution function (PSCF) model, and a concentration-weighted trajectory (CWT) method were used to evaluate the transport pathways and sources of XiAn PM10 in spring 2001 to 2003. Three dust source areas: "Northwesterly Sources," "Northerly Sources," and a "Loess Plateau Source" and an anthropogenic "Southerly Source" contributing to the high particulate matter concentrations at XiAn were identified using these methods. The CWT method provided more compelling information on dust sources than the PSCF model, but there are clear advantages to using multiple interpretive tools. A comparison of the major dust transport pathways shows differences for XiAn versus Beijing, with "Northwesterly Sources" more important for XiAn and arid and semi-arid regions in Mongolia more important for Beijing. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This study re-examines the possible impacts of anthropogenic aerosols (AERs), which are primarily concentrated in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics, on atmospheric general circulation changes in the Southern Hemisphere (SH). The long-term trends of the SH Hadley Cell edge and Southern Annular Mode (SAM) are evaluated for the historical and single forcing experiments of 12 models archived for the Fifth Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP5). The AER-induced temperature changes are typically opposite in sign to that of the greenhouse gas (GHG)-induced changes. However, the zonal-mean circulation changes driven by the AERs are not simply opposite to those due to the GHGs. Depending on the analysis period, they can be either opposite or the same as the GHG-induced ones. It is also found that the inter-model spread of AER-driven circulation changes is primarily dependent on the uncertainty of tropospheric temperature changes, particularly static stability changes in the subtropics, whereas that of GHG-induced changes in the austral summer is influenced by the uncertainty of both the tropospheric and polar lower-stratospheric temperature changes. This accentuates that the AER-induced SH circulation changes are not simply mirroring the GHG-induced ones.},

abstract = {This work analyses atmospheric transport of natural and anthropogenic pollution to the South Shetland Islands (SSI), with particular reference to the period September 2015 – August 2017. Based on data from the Global Volcanism Program database and air mass back trajectories calculated using the HySPLIT model, it was found that it is possible that in the analysed period volcanic pollution was supplied via long-range transport from South America, and from the South Sandwich Islands. Air masses flowed in over the South Shetland Islands from the South America region relatively frequently – 226 times during the study period, which suggests the additional possibility of anthropogenic pollution being supplied by this means. In certain cases the trajectories also indicated the possibility of atmospheric transport from the New Zealand region, and even from the south-eastern coast of Australia. The analysis of the obtained results is compared against the background of research by other authors. This is done to indicate that research into the origin of chemical compounds in the Antarctic environment should take into account the possible influx of pollutants from remote areas during the sampling period, as well as the possible reemission of compounds accumulated in snow and ice.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of feature extraction for estimating users' transportation modes from their movement trajectories. Previous studies have adopted supervised learning approaches and used engineers' skills to find effective features for accurate estimation. However, such handcrafted features cannot always work well because human behaviors are diverse and trajectories include noise due to measurement error. To compensate for the shortcomings of handcrafted features, we propose a method that automatically extracts additional features using a deep neural network (DNN). In order that a DNN can easily handle input trajectories, our method converts a raw trajectory data structure into an image data structure while maintaining effective spatiotemporal information. A classification model is constructed in a supervised manner using both of the deep features and handcrafted features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through several experiments using two real datasets, such as accuracy comparisons with previous methods and feature visualization.},

The resulting high NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}x{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} emission flux may explain the little preservation of NO{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater}{\textless}sup{\textgreater}{\&}ndash;{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} in snow ({\~{}} 30{\%}) when compared to Summit, Greenland (75–93{\%}).

Thus, the origins of the air masses reaching WAIS Divide during this campaign were investigated with a 4-day back-trajectory analysis every 4 h. The resulting 168 back trajectories revealed that in 75{\%} of all runs air originated from the Antarctic coastal slopes (58{\%}) and the inner WAIS (17{\%}). For these air sources O{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} levels were on average 13 ± 3 ppbv. The remaining 25{\%} are katabatic outflows from the East Antarctic Plateau above 2500 m. When near-surface air from the East Antarctic Plateau reaches WAIS Divide through a rapid transport of less than 3 days, O{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} levels are on average 19 ± 4 ppbv with maximum mixing ratios of 30 ppbv. Episodes of elevated ozone at WAIS Divide are therefore linked to air mass export off the East Antarctic Plateau, demonstrating that outflows from the highly oxidizing summer atmospheric boundary layer in the interior of the continent can episodically raise the mixing ratios of long-lived atmospheric chemical species such as O{\textless}sub{\textgreater}3{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} and enhance the oxidative capacity of the atmosphere above WAIS.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Trajectory clustering, which aims at discovering groups of similar trajectories, has long been considered as a corner stone task for revealing movement patterns as well as facilitating higher-level applications like location prediction. While a plethora of trajectory clustering techniques have been proposed, they often rely on spatiotemporal similarity measures that are not space-and time-invariant. As a result, they cannot detect trajectory clusters where the within-cluster similarity occurs in different regions and time periods. In this paper, we revisit the trajectory clustering problem by learning quality low-dimensional representations of the trajectories. We first use a sliding window to extract a set of moving behavior features that capture space-and time-invariant characteristics of the trajectories. With the feature extraction module, we transform each trajectory into a feature sequence to describe object movements, and further employ a sequence to sequence auto-encoder to learn fixed-length deep representations. The learnt representations robustly encode the movement characteristics of the objects and thus lead to space-and time-invariant clusters. We evaluate the proposed method on both synthetic and real data, and observe significant performance improvements over existing methods.},

abstract = {This study compares the climatology and long-term trend of northern winter stratospheric residual mean meridional circulation (RMMC), as well as its responses to El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), stratospheric Quasi Biennial Oscillation (QBO), and solar cycle in ten reanalyses and a stratosphere-resolving model, CESM1-WACCM. The RMMC is a large-scale meridional circulation cell in the stratosphere, usually referred to as the estimate of the Brewer Dobson circulation (BDC). The distribution of the BDC is generally consistent among multiple reanalyses except that the NOAA twentieth century reanalysis (20RC) largely underestimates it. Most reanalyses (except ERA40 and ERA-Interim) show a strengthening trend for the BDC during 1979-2010. All reanalyses and CESM1-WACCM consistently reveal that the deep branch of the BDC is significantly enhanced in El Ni{\~{n}}o winters as more waves from the troposphere dissipate in the stratospheric polar vortex region. A secondary circulation cell is coupled to the temperature anomalies below the QBO easterly center at 50 hPa with tropical upwelling/cooling and midlatitude downwelling/warming, and similar secondary circulation cells also appear between 50-10 hPa and above 10 hPa to balance the temperature anomalies. The direct BDC response to QBO in the upper stratosphere creates a barrier near 30°N to prevent waves from propagating to midlatitudes, contributing to the weakening of the polar vortex. The shallow branch of the BDC in the lower stratosphere is intensified during solar minima, and the downwelling warms the Arctic lower stratosphere. The stratospheric responses to QBO and solar cycle in most reanalyses are generally consistent except in the two 20CRs.. (2019).

abstract = {Abstract. Surface ozone has been measured since 2004 at the coastal East Antarctic site of Dumont d'Urville (DDU), and since 2007 at the Concordia station located on the high East Antarctic plateau. This paper discusses long-term changes, seasonal and diurnal cycles, as well as inter-annual summer variability observed at these two East Antarctic sites. At Concordia, near-surface ozone data were complemented by balloon soundings and compared to similar measurements done at the South Pole. The DDU record is compared to those obtained at the coastal site of Syowa, also located in East Antarctica, as well as the coastal sites of Neumayer and Halley, both located on the coast of the Weddell Sea in West Antarctica. Surface ozone mixing ratios exhibit very similar seasonal cycles at Concordia and the South Pole. However, in summer the diurnal cycle of ozone is different at the two sites with a drop of ozone in the afternoon at Concordia but not at the South Pole. The vertical distribution of ozone above the snow surface also differs. When present, the ozone-rich layer located near the ground is better mixed and deeper at Concordia (up to 400 m) than at the South Pole during sunlight hours. These differences are related to different solar radiation and wind regimes encountered at these two inland sites. DDU appears to be the coastal site where the impact of the late winter/spring bromine chemistry is the weakest, but where the impact of elevated ozone levels caused by NOx snow emissions from the high Antarctic plateau is the highest. The highest impact of the bromine chemistry is seen at Halley and Neumayer, and to a lesser extent at Syowa. These three sites are only weakly impacted by the NOx chemistry and the net ozone production occurring on the high Antarctic plateau. The differences in late winter/spring are attributed to the abundance of sea ice offshore from the sites, whereas those in summer are related to the topography of East Antarctica that promotes the katabatic flow bringing oxidant-rich inland air masses to the site. There appears to be a decreasing change in summer surface ozone at the two East Antarctic sites of Concordia and DDU over the most recent period (2004–2014 and 2007–2014). Further research, including continued monitoring, is needed at these two sites to better separate the effect of synoptic transport from possible change of NOx snow emissions in response to recovery of the stratospheric ozone layer leading to penetration of more UV radiation to the surface.},

abstract = {Results of three hybrid receptor models, potential source contribution function (PSCF), concentration weighted trajectory (CWT), and residence time weighted concentration (RTWC), were compared for locating polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) sources contributing to the atmospheric concentrations in Chicago. Variations of these models, including PSCF using mean and 75{\%} criterion concentrations, joint probability PSCF (JP-PSCF), changes of point filters and grid cell sizes for RTWC, and PSCF using wind trajectories started at different altitudes, are also discussed. Modeling results were relatively consistent between models. However, no single model provided as complete information as was obtained by using all of them. CWT and 75{\%} PSCF appears to be able to distinguish between larger sources and moderate ones. RTWC resolved high potential source areas. RTWC and JP-PSCF pooling data from all sampling sites removed the trailing effect often seen in PSCF modeling. PSCF results using average concentration criteria, appears to identify both moderate and major sources. Each model has advantages and disadvantages. However, used in combination, they provide information that is not available if only one of them is used. For short-range atmospheric transport, PSCF results were consistent when using wind trajectories starting at different heights. Based on the archived PCB data, the modeling results indicate there is a large potential source area between Joliet and Kankakee, IL, and two moderate sources to the northwest and south of Chicago. On the south side of Chicago in the neighborhood of Lake Calumet, several PCB sources were identified. Other unidentified potential source location(s) will require additional upwind/downwind field sampling to verify modeling results. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Techniques for understanding video object motion activity are becoming increasingly important with the widespread adoption of CCTV surveillance systems. In this paper we propose a novel vision system for clustering and classification of object-based video motion clips using spatiotemporal models. Object trajectories are modeled as motion time series using the lowest order Fourier coefficients obtained by Discrete Fourier Transform. Trajectory clustering is then carried out in the DFT-coefficient feature space to discover patterns of similar object motion activity. The DFT coefficients are used as input feature vectors to a Self-Organising Map which can learn similarities between object trajectories in an unsupervised manner. Encoding trajectories in this way leads to efficiency gains over existing approaches that use discrete point-based flow vectors to represent the whole trajectory. Assuming the clusters of trajectory points are distributed normally in the coefficient feature space, we propose a simple Mahalanobis classifier for the detection of anomalous trajectories. Our proposed techniques are validated on three different datasets-Australian sign language, hand-labelled object trajectories from video surveillance footage and real-time tracking data obtained in the laboratory. Applications to event detection and motion data mining for visual surveillance systems are envisaged.},

However, the air quality over this continent can be affected by long-lived anthropogenic pollutants from the mainland. The Argentinian region of Ushuaia is often the main source area of accumulated hazardous gases over the Antarctic Peninsula. The main objective of this study is to report the first in situ observations yet known of surface ozone (O3) over Ushuaia, the Drake Passage, and Coastal Antarctic Peninsula (CAP) on board the RV Australis during the Malaysian Antarctic Scientific Expedition Cruise 2016 (MASEC'16). Hourly O3 data was measured continuously for 23 days using an EcoTech O3 analyzer. To understand more about the distribution of surface O3 over the Antarctic, we present the spatial and temporal of surface O3 of long-term data (2009–2015) obtained online from the World Meteorology Organization of World Data Centre for greenhouse gases (WMO WDCGG). Furthermore, surface O3 satellite data from the free online NOAA-Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) database and online data assimilation from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)-Monitoring Atmospheric Composition and Climate (MACC) were used. The data from both online products are compared to document the data sets and to give an indication of its quality towards in situ data. Finally, we used past carbon monoxide (CO) data as a proxy of surface O3 formation over Ushuaia and the Antarctic region. Our key findings were that the surface O3 mixing ratio during MASEC'16 increased from a minimum of 5 ppb to {\~{}} 10–13 ppb approaching the Drake Passage and the Coastal Antarctic Peninsula (CAP) region. The anthropogenic and biogenic O3 precursors from Ushuaia and the marine region influenced the mixing ratio of surface O3 over the Drake Passage and CAP region. The past data from WDCGG showed that the annual O3 cycle has a maximum during the winter of 30 to 35 ppb between June and August and a minimum during the summer (January to February) of 10 to 20 ppb. The surface O3 mixing ratio during the summer was controlled by photochemical processes in the presence of sunlight, leading to the depletion process. During the winter, the photochemical production of surface O3 was more dominant. The NOAA-AIRS and ECMWF-MACC analysis agreed well with the MASEC'16 data but twice were higher during the expedition period. Finally, the CO past data showed the surface O3 mixing ratio was influenced by the CO mixing ratio over both the Ushuaia and Antarctic regions. Peak surface O3 and CO hourly mixing ratios reached up to {\~{}} 38 ppb (O3) and {\~{}} 500 ppb (CO) over Ushuaia. High CO over Ushuaia led to the depletion process of surface O3 over the region. Monthly CO mixing ratio over Antarctic (South Pole) were low, leading to the production of surface O3 over the Antarctic region.},

abstract = {A new method of trajectory statistics was developed which allows the identification of source areas with higher spatial resolution than other methods. It uses ambient air pollutant concentration measurements at a receptor site and corresponding back trajectories arriving at that site. In a first step, each pollutant concentration is attributed to its trajectory. From this, a first guess 'concentration field' is computed which shows potential source areas of the respective pollutant. In an iterative procedure, the concentrations are redistributed along their corresponding trajectories which continuously improves the 'concentration field'. The new method was tested with a large set of back trajectories ending at 14 measurement sites of the EMEP network. It was used to identify potential source areas of particulate sulfate. The procedure successfully identified many source areas with a much higher resolution than what would have been achievable with existing methods. The locations of the source areas were compared with the locations of the emission maxima of an emission inventory and a good agreement was found, both qualitatively and quantitatively.},

Subsequently, BC levels at Preila associated with each air mass cluster during this period were analyzed. The PSCF and CWT analysis shows that, on high BC concentration days, the air masses commonly originated and passed over southern regions of Europe before arriving at Preila in winter, while a strong impact of wildfires was observed in spring.},

Ice cores provide a wealth of information about past climate and atmospheric circulation however a good understanding of the precipitation patterns, potential source regions and transport pathways is essential in their interpretation. Here we investigate the precipitation pathways for a transect of five new ice cores drilled in the southern Antarctic Peninsula and Ellsworth Land. We utilize in situ observations from automatic weather stations to confirm that the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA-Interim reanalysis data adequately captures annual and sub-annual variability, with evidence of a slight cold bias in the 2 m temperatures. Back trajectory analysis, from the British Atmospheric Data Centre trajectory service, reveals that warm and snowy years are associated with air masses that originate (5 days before reaching the site) from the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea, while cold and dry years are associated with air masses from the Antarctic continent. There is a clear seasonal migration in the trajectories at each site, reflecting the east to west migration of the Amundsen Sea Low, known to have a strong influence on climate in this region.},

Most existing methods are based on various Markov chain models, in which the predicted destinations are trained by historical trajectories. A problem among most of these follow-up works is that they blindly rely on Markov process, ignoring the Geographical distribution and the time-property of trajectories. In this paper, we propose a novel destination prediction algorithm, called STTL, based on the time-property of the partial trajectory, alongwith the semantic transfer probability model trained in advance. We have conducted extensive experiments on Shanghai Taxi dataset. The experimental results shows that STTL outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.},

The dynamical links are revealed using a metric based on extreme stratospheric planetary-scale wave heat flux events, defined as the 10th and 90th percentiles of the daily high-latitude wave 1 heat flux distribution at 50 hPa. We show extreme negative (positive) heat flux events are linked to a westward (eastward) shift in the Amundsen Sea Low and anomalous warming (cooling) over the Amundsen Bellingshausen Seas in reanalysis data. Since coupling to the stratosphere via planetary waves has significant impacts on the tropospheric circulation of both hemispheres, it is important to understand which coupled climate models can reproduce this phenomenon. The heat flux metric is used to evaluate troposphere-stratosphere coupling in models participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and compare their performance across hemispheres. The results show that models with a degraded representation of stratospheric extremes exhibit robust biases in tropospheric sea level pressure variability over the Antarctic Peninsula. Models which fail to capture the extremes in stratospheric heat flux, significantly underestimate the variance of the distribution of mean sea level pressure anomalies over Western Antarctica.},

abstract = {To assess air pollution emitted in Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes and transported to Antarctica, we investigate the climatological mean and temporal trends in aerosol optical depth (AOD), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), and formaldehyde (HCHO) columns using satellite observations. Generally, all these measurements exhibit sharp peaks over and near the three nearby inhabited continents: South America, Africa, and Australia. This pattern indicates the large emission effect of anthropogenic activities and biomass burning processes. High AOD is also found over the Southern Atlantic Ocean, probably because of the sea salt production driven by strong winds. Since the pristine Antarctic atmosphere can be polluted by transport of air pollutants from the mid-latitudes, we analyze the 10-day back trajectories that arrive at Antarctic ground stations in consideration of the spatial distribution of mid-latitudinal AOD, CO, NO 2 , and HCHO. We find that the influence of mid-latitudinal emission differs across Antarctic regions: western Antarctic regions show relatively more back trajectories from the mid-latitudes, while the eastern Antarctic regions do not show large intrusions of mid-latitudinal air masses. Finally, we estimate the long-term trends in AOD, CO, NO 2 , and HCHO during the past decade (2005-2016). While CO shows a significant negative trend, the others show overall positive trends. Seasonal and regional differences in trends are also discussed.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd. Trajectory clustering, which aims at discovering groups of similar trajectories, has long been considered as a corner stone task for revealing movement patterns as well as facilitating higher level applications such as location prediction and activity recognition. Although a plethora of trajectory clustering techniques have been proposed, they often rely on spatio-temporal similarity measures that are not space and time invariant. As a result, they cannot detect trajectory clusters where the within-cluster similarity occurs in different regions and time periods. In this paper, we revisit the trajectory clustering problem by learning quality low-dimensional representations of the trajectories. We first use a sliding window to extract a set of moving behaviour features that capture space- and time-invariant characteristics of the trajectories. With the feature extraction module, we transform each trajectory into a feature sequence to describe object movements and further employ a sequence-to-sequence auto-encoder to learn fixed-length deep representations. The learnt representations robustly encode the movement characteristics of the objects and thus lead to space- and time-invariant clusters. We evaluate the proposed method on both synthetic and real data and observe significant performance improvements over existing methods.},

abstract = {The implementation of European emission abatement strategies has led to a significant reduction in the emissions of ozone precursors during the last decade. Ground-level ozone is also influenced by meteorological factors such as temperature, which exhibit interannual variability and are expected to change in the future. The impacts of climate change on air quality are usually investigated through air-quality models that simulate interactions between emissions, meteorology and chemistry. Within a multi-model assessment, this study aims to better understand how air-quality models represent the relationship between meteorological variables and surface ozone concentrations over Europe. A multiple linear regression (MLR) approach is applied to observed and modelled time series across 10 European regions in springtime and summertime for the period of 2000-2010 for both models and observations. Overall, the air-quality models are in better agreement with observations in summertime than in springtime and particularly in certain regions, such as France, central Europe or eastern Europe, where local meteorological variables show a strong influence on surface ozone concentrations. Larger discrepancies are found for the southern regions, such as the Balkans, the Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean basin, especially in springtime. We show that the air-quality models do not properly reproduce the sensitivity of surface ozone to some of the main meteorological drivers, such as maximum temperature, relative humidity and surface solar radiation. Specifically, all air-quality models show more limitations in capturing the strength of the ozone-relative-humidity relationship detected in the observed time series in most of the regions, for both seasons. Here, we speculate that dry-deposition schemes in the air-quality models might play an essential role in capturing this relationship. We further quantify the relationship between ozone and maximum temperature (mo3-T, climate penalty) in observations and air-quality models. In summertime, most of the air-quality models are able to reproduce the observed climate penalty reasonably well in certain regions such as France, central Europe and northern Italy. However, larger discrepancies are found in springtime, where air-quality models tend to overestimate the magnitude of the observed climate penalty.},

abstract = {Increases in free tropospheric ozone over the past two decades are mainly in the Northern Hemisphere that have been widely documented, while ozone trends in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) remain largely unexplained. Here we first show that in-situ and satellite observations document increases of tropospheric ozone in the SH over 1990–2015. We then use a global chemical transport model to diagnose drivers of these trends. We find that increases of anthropogenic emissions (including methane) are not the most significant contributors. Instead, we explain the trend as due to changes in meteorology, and particularly in transport patterns. We propose a possible linkage of the ozone increases to meridional transport pattern shifts driven by poleward expansion of the SH Hadley circulation (SHHC). The SHHC poleward expansion allows more downward transport of ozone from the stratosphere to the troposphere at higher latitudes, and also enhances tropospheric ozone production through stronger lifting of tropical ozone precursors to the upper troposphere. These together may lead to increasing tropospheric ozone in the extratropical SH, particularly in the middle/upper troposphere and in austral autumn. Poleward expansion of the Hadley circulation is partly driven by greenhouse warming, and the associated increase in tropospheric ozone potentially provides a positive climate feedback amplifying the warming that merits further quantification.},

abstract = {In a series of 10-day campaigns in Ontario and Quebec, Canada, between 2005 and 2007, ozonesondes were launched twice daily in conjunction with continuous high-resolution wind-profiling radar measurements. Windprofilers can measure rapid changes in the height of the tropopause, and in some cases follow stratospheric intrusions. Observed stratospheric intrusions were studied with the aid of a Lagrangian particle dispersion model and the Canadian operational weather forecast system. Definite stratosphere-troposphere transport (STT) events occurred approximately every 2-3 days during the spring and summer campaigns, whereas during autumn and winter, the frequency was reduced to every 4-5 days. Although most events reached the lower troposphere, only three events appear to have significantly contributed to ozone amounts in the surface boundary layer. Detailed calculations find that STT, while highly variable, is responsible for an average, over the seven campaigns, of 3.1{\%} of boundary layer ozone (1.2 ppb), but 13{\%} (5.4 ppb) in the lower troposphere and 34{\%} (22 ppb) in the middle and upper troposphere, where these layers are defined as 0-1 km, 1-3 km, and 3-8 km respectively. Estimates based on counting laminae in ozonesonde profiles, with judicious choices of ozone and relative humidity thresholds, compare moderately well, on average, with these values. The lamina detection algorithm is then applied to a large dataset from four summer ozonesonde campaigns at 18 North American sites between 2006 and 2011. The results show some site-to-site and year-to-year variability, but stratospheric ozone contributions average 4.6{\%} (boundary layer), 15{\%} (lower troposphere) and 26{\%} (middle/upper troposphere). Calculations were also performed based on the TOST global 3D trajectory-mapped ozone data product. Maps of STT in the same three layers of the troposphere suggest that the STT ozone flux is greater over the North American continent than Europe, and much greater in winter and spring than in summer or fall. When averaged over all seasons, magnitudes over North America show similar ratios between levels to the previous calculations, but are overall 3-4 times smaller. This may be because of limitations (trajectory length and vertical resolution) to the current TOST-based calculation.},

abstract = {Source term estimation for atmospheric dispersion deals with estimation of the emission strength and location of an emitting source using all available information, including site description, meteorological data, concentration observations and prior information. In this paper, Bayesian methods for source term estimation are evaluated using Prairie Grass field observations. The methods include those that require the specification of the likelihood function and those which are likelihood free, also known as approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods. The performances of five different likelihood functions in the former and six different distance measures in the latter case are compared for each component of the source parameter vector based on Nemenyi test over all the 68 data sets available in the Prairie Grass field experiment. Several likelihood functions and distance measures are introduced to source term estimation for the first time. Also, ABC method is improved in many aspects. Results show that discrepancy measures which refer to likelihood functions and distance measures collectively have significant influence on source estimation. There is no single winning algorithm, but these methods can be used collectively to provide more robust estimates.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new nonparametric Bayesian model called the dual sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model (HDP-HMM) is proposed for mining activities from a collection of time series data such as trajectories. All the time series data are clustered. Each cluster of time series data, corresponding to a motion pattern, is modeled by an HMM. Our model postulates a set of HMMs that share a common set of states (topics in an analogy with topic models for document processing), but have unique transition distributions. The number of HMMs and the number of topics are both automatically determined. The sticky prior avoids redundant states and makes our HDP-HMM more effective to model multimodal observations. For the application to motion trajectory modeling, topics correspond to motion activities. The learnt topics are clustered into atomic activities which are assigned predicates. We propose a Bayesian inference method to decompose a given trajectory into a sequence of atomic activities. The sources and sinks in the scene are learnt by clustering endpoints (origins and destinations) of trajectories. The semantic motion regions are learnt using the points in trajectories. On combining the learnt sources and sinks, the learnt semantic motion regions, and the learnt sequence of atomic activities, the action represented by a trajectory can be described in natural language in as automatic a way as possible. The effectiveness of our dual sticky HDP-HMM is validated on several trajectory datasets. The effectiveness of the natural language descriptions for motions is demonstrated on the vehicle trajectories extracted from a traffic scene.},

abstract = {With the rapid spread of built-in GPS handheld smart devices, the trajectory data from GPS sensors has grown explosively. Trajectory data has spatio-temporal characteristics and rich information. Using trajectory data processing techniques can mine the patterns of human activities and the moving patterns of vehicles in the intelligent transportation systems. A trajectory similarity measure is one of the most important issues in trajectory data mining (clustering, classification, frequent pattern mining, etc.). Unfortunately, the main similarity measure algorithms with the trajectory data have been found to be inaccurate, highly sensitive of sampling methods, and have low robustness for the noise data. To solve the above problems, three distances and their corresponding computation methods are proposed in this paper. The point-segment distance can decrease the sensitivity of the point sampling methods. The prediction distance optimizes the temporal distance with the features of trajectory data. The segment-segment distance introduces the trajectory shape factor into the similarity measurement to improve the accuracy. The three kinds of distance are integrated with the traditional dynamic time warping algorithm (DTW) algorithm to propose a new segment–based dynamic time warping algorithm (SDTW). The experimental results show that the SDTW algorithm can exhibit about 57{\%}, 86{\%}, and 31{\%} better accuracy than the longest common subsequence algorithm (LCSS), and edit distance on real sequence algorithm (EDR) , and DTW, respectively, and that the sensitivity to the noise data is lower than that those algorithms.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulation methods produce trajectories of atomic positions (and optionally velocities and energies) as a function of time and provide a representation of the sampling of a given molecule's energetically accessible conformational ensemble. As simulations on the 10-100 ns time scale become routine, with sampled configurations stored on the picosecond time scale, such trajectories contain large amounts of data. Data-mining techniques, like clustering, provide one means to group and make sense of the information in the trajectory. In this work, several clustering algorithms were implemented, compared, and utilized to understand MD trajectory data. The development of the algorithms into a freely available C code library, and their application to a simple test example of random (or systematically placed) points in a 2D plane (where the pairwise metric is the distance between points) provide a means to understand the relative performance. Eleven different clustering algorithms were developed, ranging from top-down splitting (hierarchical) and bottom-up aggregating (including single-linkage edge joining, centroid-linkage, average-linkage, complete-linkage, centripetal, and centripetal-complete) to various refinement (means, Bayesian, and self-organizing maps) and tree (COBWEB) algorithms. Systematic testing in the context of MD simulation of various DNA systems (including DNA single strands and the interaction of a minor groove binding drug DB226 with a DNA hairpin) allows a more direct assessment of the relative merits of the distinct clustering algorithms. Additionally, means to assess the relative performance and differences between the algorithms, to dynamically select the initial cluster count, and to achieve faster data mining by "sieved clustering" were evaluated. Overall, it was found that there is no one perfect "one size fits all" algorithm for clustering MD trajectories and that the results strongly depend on the choice of atoms for the pairwise comparison. Some algorithms tend to produce homogeneously sized clusters, whereas others have a tendency to produce singleton clusters. Issues related to the choice of a pairwise metric, clustering metrics, which atom selection is used for the comparison, and about the relative performance are discussed. Overall, the best performance was observed with the average-linkage, means, and SOM algorithms. If the cluster count is not known in advance, the hierarchical or average-linkage clustering algorithms are recommended. Although these algorithms perform well, it is important to be aware of the limitations or weaknesses of each algorithm, specifically the high sensitivity to outliers with hierarchical, the tendency to generate homogenously sized clusters with means, and the tendency to produce small or singleton clusters with average-linkage.},

abstract = {We have developed a 5.5 year climatology of atmospheric transport into the Antarctic troposphere, which uses the same data set and methods as described in a recent study for the Arctic. This allows direct comparisons of transport properties for the two polar regions. The climatology is based on a simulation with the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART, where the model atmosphere was globally filled with particles. Transport characteristics as well as emission sensitivities were derived from 6 hourly particle positions. We found that the probability for near-surface air to originate from the stratosphere on a time scale of 10 days is an order of magnitude higher near the South Pole than near the North Pole, a result of higher topography and descent that partly compensates for the flow of air down the Antarctic Plateau with the katabatic winds. The stratospheric influence is largest in fall, which is opposite to the seasonality in the Arctic. Stratospheric influence is much smaller over the shelf ice regions and in a band around Antarctica. The average time for which air near the surface has been exposed to continuous darkness in July (continuous light in January) is longest over the Ronne Ice Shelf and Ross Ice Shelf at∼11 days (20 days). We calculated how sensitive Antarctic air masses are to emission input up to 30 days before arriving in Antarctica if removal processes are ignored. The emission sensitivity shows strong meridional gradients and, as a result, is generally low over South America, Africa, and Australia. For a 10 day time scale, the largest emission sensitivities over these continents are 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than over Eurasia for transport to the Arctic, showing that foreign continents have a much smaller potential to pollute the Antarctic than the Arctic troposphere. Emission sensitivities and derived black carbon (BC) source contributions over South America, Africa, and Australia are substantially (a factor 10 for Africa) larger in winter than in summer. In winter, biomass burning contributes more BC than anthropogenic sources. For typical aerosol lifetimes of 5-10 days, ship emissions south of 60°S account for half of the total BC concentrations in the lowest 1000 m of the atmosphere south of 70°S in December. The increasing number of tourists visiting Antarctica and fishing vessels operating close to Antarctica are, therefore, a matter of concern.

abstract = {Volcanic sulfate aerosols play a key role in air quality and climate. However, the rate of oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO2) precursor gas to sulfate aerosols (SO2-4 ) in volcanic plumes is poorly known, especially in the troposphere. Here we determine the chemical speciation as well as the intensity and temporal persistence of the impact on air quality of sulfate aerosols from the 2014-2015 Holuhraun flood lava eruption of Icelandic volcano B{\'{a}}rdarbunga. To do so, we jointly analyse a set of SO2 observations from satellite (OMPS and IASI) and ground-level measurements from air quality monitoring stations together with high temporal resolution mass spectrometry measurements of an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (ACSM) performed far from the volcanic source. We explore month/year long ACSM data in France from stations in contrasting environments, close and far from industrial sulfur-rich activities. We demonstrate that volcanic sulfate aerosols exhibit a distinct chemical signature in urban/rural conditions, with NO3 : SO4 mass concentration ratios lower than for non-volcanic background aerosols. These results are supported by thermodynamic simulations of aerosol composition, using the ISORROPIA II model, which show that ammonium sulfate aerosols are preferentially formed at a high concentration of sulfate, leading to a decrease in the production of particulate ammonium nitrate. Such a chemical signature is however more difficult to identify at heavily polluted industrial sites due to a high level of background noise in sulfur. Nevertheless, aged volcanic sulfates can be distinguished from freshly emitted industrial sulfates according to their contrasting degree of anion neutralization. Combining AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) sunphotometric data with ACSM observations, we also show a long persistence over weeks of pollution in volcanic sulfate aerosols, while SO2 pollution disappears in a few days at most. Finally, gathering 6-month long datasets from 27 sulfur monitoring stations of the EMEP (European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme) network allows us to demonstrate a much broader large-scale European pollution, in both SO2 and SO4, associated with the Holuhraun eruption, from Scandinavia to France. While widespread SO2 anomalies, with ground-level mass concentrations far exceeding background values, almost entirely result from the volcanic source, the origin of sulfate aerosols is more complex. Using a multi-site concentration-weighted trajectory analysis, emissions from the Holuhraun eruption are shown to be one of the main sources of SO4 at all EMEP sites across Europe and can be distinguished from anthropogenic emissions from eastern Europe but also from Great Britain. A wide variability in SO2 : SO4 mass concentration ratios, ranging from 0.8 to 8.0, is shown at several stations geographically dispersed at thousands of kilometres from the eruption site. Despite this apparent spatial complexity, we demonstrate that these mass oxidation ratios can be explained by a simple linear dependency on the age of the plume, with a SO2-to-SO4 oxidation rate of 0.23 h-1. Most current studies generally focus on SO2, an unambiguous and more readily measured marker of the volcanic plume. However, the long persistence of the chemical fingerprint of volcanic sulfate aerosols at continental scale, as shown for the Holuhraun eruption here, casts light on the impact of tropospheric eruptions and passive degassing activities on air quality, health, atmospheric chemistry and climate.},

abstract = {AbstractThis study examines the timescales of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) tropospheric circulation response to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations in Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) models. In response to an abrupt quadrupling of atmospheric CO2, the midlatitude jet stream and poleward edge of the Hadley circulation shift poleward on the timescale of the rising global-mean surface temperature during the summer and fall seasons, but on a much more rapid timescale during the winter and spring seasons. The seasonally varying timescales of the SH circulation response are closely tied to the meridional temperature gradient in the upper troposphere-lower stratosphere and, in particular, to temperatures in the SH polar lower stratosphere. During summer and fall, SH polar lower stratospheric temperatures cool on the timescale of warming global surface temperatures, as the lifting of the tropopause height with tropospheric warming is associated with cooling at lower stratospheric levels. However, during winter and spring, SH polar lower stratospheric temperatures cool primarily from fast timescale radiative processes, contributing to the faster timescale circulation response during these seasons.The poleward edge of the SH subtropical dry zone shifts poleward on the timescale of the rising global-mean surface temperature during all seasons in response to an abrupt quadrupling of atmospheric CO2. The dry zone edge initially follows the poleward shift in the Hadley cell edge, but is then augmented by the action of eddy moisture fluxes in a warming climate. Consequently, with increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, key features of the tropospheric circulation response could emerge sooner than features more closely tied to rising global temperatures.},

abstract = {Fugitive pollutant sources from the oil and gas industry are typically quite difficult to find within industrial plants and refineries, yet they are a significant contributor of global greenhouse gas emissions. A novel approach for locating fugitive emission sources using computationally efficient trajectory statistical methods (TSM) has been investigated in detailed proof-of-concept simulations. Four TSMs were examined in a variety of source emissions scenarios developed using transient CFD simulations on the simplified geometry of an actual gas plant: potential source contribution function (PSCF), concentration weighted trajectory (CWT), residence time weighted concentration (RTWC), and quantitative transport bias analysis (QTBA). Quantitative comparisons were made using a correlation measure based on search area from the source(s). PSCF, CWT and RTWC could all distinguish areas near major sources from the surroundings. QTBA successfully located sources in only some cases, even when provided with a large data set. RTWC, given sufficient domain trajectory coverage, distinguished source areas best, but otherwise could produce false source predictions. Using RTWC in conjunction with CWT could overcome this issue as well as reduce sensitivity to noise in the data. The results demonstrate that TSMs are a promising approach for identifying fugitive emissions sources within complex facility geometries. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The mean mixing ratio of surface O3, NOX, CO, CH4 and NMHCs were 29.5 ± 7.3 ppb, 34.7 ± 11.2 ppb, 1.82 ± 0.52 ppm, 3.07 ± 0.37 ppm and 0.53 ± 0.17 ppm, respectively. This study also comprises an analysis of the relation between UV irradiance and surface O3. A relationship between the total oxidant concentrations (OX) and NOX has been used to identify the regional background O3 values and the local levels of primary pollution. An attempt has been made to identify the existence of NOX or NMHC sensitive regime by charting out relationships between O3, NOX and NMHCs. The respective high pollution periods of surface O3 and PM differ on a seasonal timescale. Linear regression analysis has been used to quantify the negative influence of the chemical constituents of PM (elemental carbon, NO3 −, SO4 2−) on O3 values. Statistical validation using bivariate correlation analysis, multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis and principal component analysis (PCA) strongly describes the intricate relationships among the aforesaid variables and meteorology. Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) and Concentration Weighted Trajectory (CWT) analysis indicated upper Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) as a significant source region of O3 precursor gases contributing for O3 values at the study site.},

abstract = {[1] The size-and time-resolved measurement of particulate trace elements was made using an eight-stage Davis Rotating Unit for Monitoring sampler and synchrotron X-ray fluorescence system from 29 March to 29 May in 2002 at Gosan, Korea, which is one of the representative background sites in east Asia. As a result, continuous 3-hour average concentrations were obtained for 19 elements including S, Si, Al, Fe, Ca, Cl, Cu, Zn, Ti, K, Mn, Pb, Ni, V, Se, As, Rb, Cr, and Br. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) method was applied to the size-resolved aerosol data sets in order to identify the possible sources and to estimate their contribution to particulate matter mass in each size range. Twelve sources were then resolved in the fine size range (0.07 {\$} 1.15 mm), including continental aerosol, biomass burning, coal combustion, oil heating furnace, residual oil fired boiler, municipal incineration, nonferrous metal source, ferrous metal source, gasoline vehicle, diesel vehicle, copper smelter, and volcanic emission. A newly developed hybrid receptor model, concentration, retention time, and source emission weighted trajectory (CRSWT), was then applied to the source intensities derived from the PMF analysis by incorporating meteorological and source inventory information of the study region in order to suggest the regional information of long-range transported fine aerosol sources. The CRSWT model was able to resolve highly potential source areas and pathways for the fine ambient aerosol at the Gosan background site. Citation: Han, J. S., K. J. Moon, and Y. J.

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2017. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.  We report on the first summer of high-sensitivity radon measurements from a two-filter detector at Jang Bogo Station (Terra Nova Bay) and contrast them with simultaneous observations at King Sejong Station (King George Island). King Sejong radon concentrations were characteristic of a marine baseline station (0.02–0.3 Bq m −3 ), whereas Jang Bogo values were highly variable (0.06–5.2 Bq m −3 ), mainly due to emissions from exposed coastal ground (estimated mean flux 0.09–0.11 atoms cm −2  s −1 ) and shallow atmospheric mixing depths. For wind speeds of ≤3.5 m s −1 the influence of local radon emissions became increasingly more prominent at both sites. A cluster analysis of back trajectories from King Sejong (62°S) revealed a fairly even distribution between air masses that had passed recently over South America, the Southern Ocean, and Antarctica, whereas at Jang Bogo (75°S) 80{\%} of events had recently passed over the Ross Ice Shelf and West Antarctica, 12{\%} were synoptically forced over Cape Adare, and 8{\%} were associated with subsidence over the Antarctic interior and katabatic flow to the station. When cross-checked against radon concentrations, only half of the back trajectories ending at Jang Bogo that had indicated distant contact with nonpolar southern hemisphere continents within the past 10 days showed actual signs of terrestrial influence. A simple-to-implement technique based on high-pass filtered absolute humidity is developed to distinguish between predominantly katabatic, oceanic, and near-coastal air masses for characterization of trace gas and aerosol measurements at coastal East Antarctic sites.},

abstract = {100 ppbv in the North China Plain, Fenwei Plain, Yangtze River Delta, and Pearl River Delta city clusters. These high ozone episodes are usually associated with high temperatures, which induce large BVOC emissions and enhance ozone chemical production. Our results indicate that there would be no days with MDA8 ozone {\textgreater} 80 ppbv in these major Chinese cities in the absence of domestic anthropogenic emissions. We find that the 2017 ozone increases relative to 2016 are largely due to higher background ozone driven by hotter and drier weather conditions, while changes in domestic anthropogenic emissions alone would have led to ozone decreases in 2017. Meteorological conditions in 2017 favor natural source contributions (particularly soil NOx and BVOC ozone enhancements) and ozone chemical production, increase the thermal decomposition of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), and further decrease ozone dry deposition velocity. More stringent emission control measures are thus required to offset the adverse effects of unfavorable meteorology, such as high temperature, on surface ozone air quality.]]{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Existing studies on transportation mode detection from global positioning system (GPS) trajectories mainly adopt handcrafted fea- tures. These features require researchers with a professional background and do not always work well because of the complexity of traffic behavior. To address these issues, we propose a model using a sparse autoencoder to extract point-level deep features from point-level handcrafted features. A convolution neural network then aggregates the point-level deep features and generates a trajectory-level deep feature. A deep neural network in- corporates the trajectory-level handcrafted features and the trajectory-level deep feature for detecting the users' transportation modes. Experiments conducted on Microsoft's GeoLife data show that our model can automati- cally extract the effective features and improve the accuracy of transporta- tionmode detection. Compared with themodel using only handcrafted fea- tures and shallow classifiers, the proposed model increases the maximum accuracy by 6{\%}.},

We demonstrate that multi-day (minimum 3-day duration) anticyclones play a key role in the ABS by dynamically inducing meridional transport, which is associated with heat and moisture advection into WA. This affects surface climate variability and trends, precipitation rates and thus WA ice sheet surface mass balance. We show that the snow accumulation record from the Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution (RICE) ice core reflects interannual variability of blocking and geopotential height conditions in the ABS/Ross Sea region. Furthermore, our analysis shows that larger precipitation events are related to enhanced anticyclonic circulation and meridional winds, which cause pronounced dipole patterns in air temperature anomalies and sea ice concentrations between the eastern Ross Sea and the Bellingshausen Sea/Weddell Sea, as well as between the eastern and western Ross Sea.},

abstract = {Ambient gaseous phase mercury concentrations (TGM) were measured at three locations in NY State including Potsdam, Stockton, and Sterling from May 2000 to March 2005. Using these data, three hybrid receptor models incorporating backward trajectories were used to identify source areas for TGM. The models used were potential source contribution function (PSCF), residence time weighted concentration (RTWC), and simplified quantitative transport bias analysis (SQTBA). Each model was applied using multi-site measurements to resolve the locations of important mercury sources for New York State. PSCF results showed that southeastern New York, Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee, Louisiana, and Virginia were important TGM source areas for these sites. RTWC identified Canadian sources including the metal production facilities in Ontario and Quebec, but US regional sources including the Ohio River Valley were also resolved. Sources in southeastern NY, Massachusetts, western Pennsylvania, Indiana, and northern Illinois were identified to be significant by SQTBA. The three modeling results were combined to locate the most important probable source locations, and those are Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and Wisconsin. The Atlantic Ocean was suggested to be a possible source as well. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Finally, motion patterns are identified by distance minimization from the centroids of the trajectory clusters.

abstract = {We propose a novel nonparametric Bayesian model, Dual Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (Dual-HDP), for trajectory analysis and semantic region modeling in surveillance settings, in an unsupervised way. In our approach, trajectories are treated as documents and observations of an object on a trajectory are treated as words in a document. Trajectories are clustered into different activities. Abnormal trajectories are detected as samples with low likelihoods. The semantic regions, which are intersections of paths commonly taken by objects, related to activities in the scene are also modeled. Dual-HDP advances the existing Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (HDP) language model. HDP only clusters co-occurring words from documents into topics and automatically decides the number of topics. Dual-HDP co-clusters both words and documents. It learns both the numbers of word topics and document clusters from data. Under our problem settings, HDP only clusters observations of objects, while Dual-HDP clusters both observations and trajectories. Experiments are evaluated on two data sets, radar tracks collected from a maritime port and visual tracks collected from a parking lot.},

For this purpose, three-dimensional (3D) potential source contribution function and concentration weighted trajectory models, as well as new hybrid receptor model, concentration weighted boundary layer (CWBL), which uses a two-dimensional grid and a planetary boundary layer height as a frame of reference, are presented. The refined approach to hybrid receptor modeling has two advantages. At first, it considers whether each trajectory endpoint meets the inclusion criteria based on planetary boundary layer height, which is expected to provide a more realistic representation of the spatial distribution of emission sources and pollutant transport pathways. Secondly, it includes pollutant time series preprocessing to make hybrid receptor models more applicable for suburban and urban locations. The 3D hybrid receptor models presented herein are designed to identify altitude distribution of potential sources, whereas CWBL can be used for analyzing the vertical distribution of pollutant concentrations along the transport pathway.},

Cyclone intensity at each six-hour position is used as the weight at that location. Only named cyclones in the Indian Ocean since 1981 are considered for this study. The K-means clustering algorithm is used to cluster Indian Ocean cyclones based on the five parameters: x-y coordinates of the mean center, variances along zonal and meridional directions, and covariance between zonal and meridional locations of the cyclone track. Four clusters are identified across the Indian Ocean; among them, only one cluster is in the North Indian Ocean (NIO) and the rest of them are in the South Indian Ocean (SIO). Other characteristics associated with each cluster, such as wind speed, lifespan, track length, track orientation, seasonality, landfall, category during landfall, total accumulated cyclone energy (ACE), and cyclone trend, are analyzed and discussed. Cyclone frequency and energy of Cluster 4 (in the NIO) have been following a linear increasing trend. Cluster 4 also has a higher number of landfall cyclones compared to other clusters. Cluster 2, located in the middle of the SIO, is characterized by the long track, high intensity, long lifespan, and high accumulated energy. Sea surface temperature (SST) and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) associated with genesis of TCs are also examined in each cluster. Cyclone genesis is co-located with the negative OLR anomaly and the positive SST anomaly. Localized SST anomalies are associated with clusters in the SIO; however, TC geneses of Cluster 4 are associated with SSTA all over the Indian Ocean (IO).},

abstract = {In a series of 10-day campaigns in Ontario and Quebec, Canada, between 2005 and 2007, ozonesondes were launched twice daily in conjunction with continuous high-resolution wind-profiling radar measurements. Windprofilers can measure rapid changes in the height of the tropopause, and in some cases follow stratospheric intrusions. Observed stratospheric intrusions were studied with the aid of a Lagrangian particle dispersion model and the Canadian operational weather forecast system. Definite stratosphere-troposphere transport (STT) events occurred approximately every 2-3 days during the spring and summer campaigns, whereas during autumn and winter, the frequency was reduced to every 4-5 days. Although most events reached the lower troposphere, only three events appear to have significantly contributed to ozone amounts in the surface boundary layer. Detailed calculations find that STT, while highly variable, is responsible for an average, over the seven campaigns, of 3.1{\%} of boundary layer ozone (1.2 ppb), but 13{\%} (5.4 ppb) in the lower troposphere and 34{\%} (22 ppb) in the middle and upper troposphere, where these layers are defined as 0-1 km, 1-3 km, and 3-8 km respectively. Estimates based on counting laminae in ozonesonde profiles, with judicious choices of ozone and relative humidity thresholds, compare moderately well, on average, with these values. The lamina detection algorithm is then applied to a large dataset from four summer ozonesonde campaigns at 18 North American sites between 2006 and 2011. The results show some site-to-site and year-to-year variability, but stratospheric ozone contributions average 4.6{\%} (boundary layer), 15{\%} (lower troposphere) and 26{\%} (middle/upper troposphere). Calculations were also performed based on the TOST global 3D trajectory-mapped ozone data product. Maps of STT in the same three layers of the troposphere suggest that the STT ozone flux is greater over the North American continent than Europe, and much greater in winter and spring than in summer or fall. When averaged over all seasons, magnitudes over North America show similar ratios between levels to the previous calculations, but are overall 3-4 times smaller. This may be because of limitations (trajectory length and vertical resolution) to the current TOST-based calculation.},

Tropical cyclones in the North Atlantic basin are clustered with K-means by mass moments, producing an optimum of six clusters with differing genesis locations, track shapes, intensities, life spans, landfalls, seasonal patterns, and trends. Even variables that are not directly clustered show distinct separation between clusters. A trend analysis confirms recent conclusions of increasing tropical cyclones in the basin over the past two decades. However, the trends vary across clusters.},

Due to desirable properties and an inherent predisposition for visualization, the Ko-honen Feature Map (or Self-Organizing Map, or SOM) algorithm is among the most popular and widely used visual clustering techniques. However, the unsupervised nature of the algorithm may be disadvantageous in certain applications. Depending on initial-ization and data characteristics, cluster maps (cluster layouts) may emerge that do not comply with user preferences, expectations, or the application context. Considering SOM-based analysis of trajectory data, we propose a comprehensive visual-interactive monitoring and control framework extending the basic SOM algorithm. The framework implements the general Visual Analytics idea to effectively combine automatic data analysis with human expert supervision. It provides simple, yet effective facilities for visually monitoring and interactively controlling the trajectory clustering process at arbitrary levels of detail. The approach allows the user to leverage existing domain knowledge and user preferences, arriving at improved cluster maps. We apply the framework on a trajectory clustering problem , demonstrating its potential in combining both unsupervised (machine) and supervised (human expert) processing, in producing appropriate cluster results.},

abstract = {Unraveling the modern budget of reactive nitrogen on the Antarctic Plateau is critical for the interpretation of ice-core records of nitrate. This requires accounting for nitrate recycling processes occurring in near-surface snow and the overlying atmospheric boundary layer. Not only concentration measurements but also isotopic ratios of nitrogen and oxygen in nitrate provide constraints on the processes at play. However, due to the large number of intertwined chemical and physical phenomena involved, numerical mod-eling is required to test hypotheses in a quantitative manner. Here we introduce the model TRANSITS (TRansfer of Atmospheric Nitrate Stable Isotopes To the Snow), a novel conceptual , multi-layer and one-dimensional model representing the impact of processes operating on nitrate at the air-snow interface on the East Antarctic Plateau, in terms of concentrations (mass fraction) and nitrogen ($\delta$ 15 N) and oxygen isotopic composition (17 O excess, 17 O) in nitrate. At the air-snow interface at Dome C (DC; 75 • 06 S, 123 • 19 E), the model reproduces well the values of $\delta$ 15 N in atmospheric and surface snow (skin layer) nitrate as well as in the $\delta$ 15 N profile in DC snow, including the observed extraordinary high positive values (around +300 ‰) below 2 cm. The model also captures the observed variability in nitrate mass fraction in the snow. While oxygen data are qualitatively reproduced at the air-snow interface at DC and in East Antarctica, the simulated 17 O values underestimate the observed 17 O values by several per mill. This is explained by the simplifications made in the description of the atmospheric cycling and oxidation of NO 2 as well as by our lack of understanding of the NO x chemistry at Dome C. The model reproduces well the sensitivity of $\delta$ 15 N, 17 O and the apparent fractiona-tion constants (15 $\epsilon$ app , 17 E app) to the snow accumulation rate. Building on this development, we propose a framework for the interpretation of nitrate records measured from ice cores. Measurement of nitrate mass fractions and $\delta$ 15},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved. There is increased evidence that stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) of ozone has a significant impact on tropospheric chemi stry and radiation. Traditional diagnostics of STE consider the ozone budget in the lowermost stratosphere (LMS) as a whole. However, this can only render the hemispherically integrated ozone flux and therefore does not distinguish the exchange of ozone into low latitudes from that into high latitudes. The exchange of ozone at different latitudes may have different tropospheric impacts. This present study extends the traditional approach from the entire LMS to individual isentropic layers in the LMS and therefore gives the meridional distribution of STE by the latitudes where each isentropic surface intersects the tropopause. The specified dynamics version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model is used to estimate the STE ozone flux on each isentropic surface. It is found that net troposphere-to-stratosphere ozone transport occurs in low latitudes along the 350-380 K isentropic surfaces and that net stratosphere-to-troposphere ozone transport takes place in the extratropics along the 280-350 K isentropes. Particularly, the seasonal cycle of extratropical STE ozone flux in the Northern Hemisphere displays a maximum in late spring and early summer, following the seasonal migration of the upper tropospheric jet and associated isentropic mixing. Furthermore, differential diabatic heating and isentropic mixing tend to induce STE ozone fluxes in opposite directions, but the net effect results in a spatiotemporal pattern similar to the STE ozone flux associated with isentropic mixing.},

abstract = {Increases in free tropospheric ozone over the past two decades are mainly in the Northern Hemisphere that have been widely documented, while ozone trends in the Southern Hemisphere (SH) remain largely unexplained. Here we first show that in-situ and satellite observations document increases of tropospheric ozone in the SH over 1990-2015. We then use a global chemical transport model to diagnose drivers of these trends. We find that increases of anthropogenic emissions (including methane) are not the most significant contributors. Instead, we explain the trend as due to changes in meteorology, and particularly in transport patterns. We propose a possible linkage of the ozone increases to meridional transport pattern shifts driven by poleward expansion of the SH Hadley circulation (SHHC). The SHHC poleward expansion allows more downward transport of ozone from the stratosphere to the troposphere at higher latitudes, and also enhances tropospheric ozone production through stronger lifting of tropical ozone precursors to the upper troposphere. These together may lead to increasing tropospheric ozone in the extratropical SH, particularly in the middle/upper tro-posphere and in austral autumn. Poleward expansion of the Hadley circulation is partly driven by greenhouse warming, and the associated increase in tropospheric ozone potentially provides a positive climate feedback amplifying the warming that merits further quantification.},

In this work, a novel tool called STEFLUX (Stratosphere-to-Troposphere Exchange Flux) is presented, discussed, and used to provide a first long-term investigation of SI over two global hot-spot regions for climate change and air pollution: the southern Himalayas and the central Mediterranean Basin. The main purpose of STEFLUX is to obtain a fast-computing and reliable identification of the SI events occurring at a specific location and during a specified time window. It relies on a compiled stratosphere-to-troposphere exchange (STE) climatology, which makes use of the ERA-Interim reanalysis dataset from the ECMWF, as well as a refined version of a well-established Lagrangian methodology. STEFLUX results are compared to the SI observations (SIO) at two high-mountain WMO/GAW global stations in these climate hot spots, i.e., the Nepal Climate Observatory-Pyramid (NCO-P, 5079{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}a.s.l.) and Mt. Cimone (2165{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}m{\textless}span class="thinspace"{\textgreater}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}a.s.l.), which are often affected by SI events. Compared to the observational datasets at the two specific measurement sites, STEFLUX is able to detect SI events on a regional scale. Furthermore, it has the advantage of retaining additional information concerning the pathway of stratospheric-affected air masses, such as the location of tropopause crossing and other meteorological parameters along the trajectories. However, STEFLUX neglects mixing and dilution that air masses undergo along their transport within the troposphere. Therefore, the regional-scale STEFLUX events cannot be expected to perfectly reproduce the point measurements at NCO-P and Mt. Cimone, which are also affected by small-scale (orographic) circulations. Still, the seasonal variability in SI events according to SIO and STEFLUX agrees fairly well. By exploiting the fact that the ERA-Interim reanalysis extends back to 1979, the long-term climatology of SI events at NCO-P and Mt. Cimone is also assessed in this work. The analysis of the 35-year record at both stations denies the existence of any significant trend in the SI frequency, except for winter seasons at NCO-P. Furthermore, for the first time, by using the STEFLUX outputs, we investigate the potential impact of specific climate factors (i.e. ENSO, QBO, and solar activity) on SI frequency variability over the Mediterranean Basin and the Himalayas.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Emissions and long-range transport of toxic metals and metalloids pose a global threat to ecosystems and human health. Global industrialization occurring from the late nineteenth century releases large quantities of pollutants into the Earth's atmosphere. Despite international efforts to mitigate emissions, accumulation of metals is still observed in the most remote regions of the planet. New baseline studies are needed to determine (i) natural background concentration of pollutants, (ii) contributions of anthropogenic emissions, and (iii) potential remobilization of previously deposited metals. Constructing such records requires distinguishing source strength from transport efficiency to the recording site and accounting for local depositional effects. Here we investigate the sensitivity and representation of Southern Hemisphere atmospheric concentrations of heavy metals (Fe, Al, Mn, Pb, Tl, and As) in the Roosevelt Island Climate Evolution (RICE) ice core, a new coastal Antarctic ice core site. Concentration variability with precipitation is explored in daily surface snow samples collected over 70 days, while seasonal deposition is investigated through snow pit sampling. We find that snow sample concentrations increase with particular snow precipitation types (rime and fog) and enhanced meridional atmospheric transport to the site. Snow pit heavy metals peak in summer and also show variable intraannual peaks. Seasonal airmass modeling based on ERA Interim reanalysis data indicates a synoptic shift during the spring and summer months. We conclude that modern heavy metal concentrations are influenced by transport efficiency and scavenging behavior; and thus, time series records from RICE have the potential to provide representative data of regional changes in heavy metals.},

The key element is an algorithm that decomposes the profiles generated for different movement parameters (velocity, acceleration etc.) using variations in sinuosity and deviation from the median line. Hence, the methodology enables the extraction of local movement features in addition to global ones that are essential for modeling and analyzing moving objects in applications such as trajectory classification, simulation and extraction of movement patterns. As a case study, we show how the method can be employed in classifying trajectory data generated by unknown moving objects and assigning them to known types of moving objects, whose movement characteristics have been previously learned. We have conducted a series of experiments that provide evidence about the similarities and differences that exist among different types of moving objects. The experiments show that the methodology can be successfully applied in automatic transport mode detection. It is also shown that eye movement data cannot be successfully used as a proxy of full-body movement of humans, or vehicles.},

The dominant airmass pathways to a coastal Antarctic ice core site at the Whitehall Glacier in the Ross Sea are modeled using snowfall and high-resolution stable isotope data between 1979 and 2006, combined with back trajectories produced from both NCEP–NCAR and ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim) data. Back trajectories generated from both datasets produce comparable results. They show that high snowfall is associated with cyclonic airflow in the Ross Sea with a strong meridional component along the western Ross Sea coast. Over a 28-yr time frame, trajectories also reveal a clear distinction between flow paths associated with above- and below-average annual temperatures (high and low $\delta$D) in the ice core record. In cold months (low $\delta$D), when there is a strengthened trough of low pressure around the continent, synoptically driven incursions of marine air across West Antarctica and trajectories originating from coastal East Antarctica are dominant. Conversely, in warmer months (high $\delta$D), airmass pathways are centered over the Ross Sea and the adjacent Southern Ocean. These trajectories are slower moving and are expected to draw marine moisture from high-latitude seasonally open oceans.},

These analyses yielded coherent pictures of transport processes causing elevated ozone concentrations in the Alps, and of the amount of ozone produced during transport over high-emission areas. Using measurement data, specific emission areas like the Po Basin, southern Germany, the 'Black Triangle' region and some areas in eastern Europe were identified as important source regions, causing elevated ozone concentrations in the Alps. These statistics were supported by model calculations of transport and formation of ozone, giving similar results. Mesoscale transport processes and ozone formation in the boundary layer along the pathways were found to play an important role in determining Alpine ozone concentration levels. Ozone concentration tendencies along transport pathways were quantified climatologically using the box model. During the last 24 h of transport, concentration increases of 6-13 ppb, on the average, were found along 60-80{\%} of all trajectories reaching the Alps, depending on the specific location. These estimates were confirmed by a measurement-based analysis of ozone formation during transport over the Po Basin, obtaining values of similar order of magnitude. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Stratosphere–troposphere coupling is investigated in relation to middle atmospheric subtropical jet (MASTJ) variations in boreal winter. An exceptional strengthening of the MASTJ occurred in association with a sudden equatorward shift of the stratospheric polar night jet (PNJ) in early December 2011. This abrupt transformation of the MASTJ and PNJ had no apparent relation to the upward propagation of planetary waves from the troposphere. The impact of this stratospheric event penetrated into the troposphere in two regions: in the north polar region and the tropics. Due to the strong MASTJ planetary waves at higher latitudes were deflected and trapped in the north polar region. Trapping of the planetary waves resulted in amplification of zonal wavenumber 1 component, which appeared in the troposphere as the development of a trough over the Atlantic sector and a ridge over the Eurasian sector. A strong MASTJ also suppressed the equatorward propagation of planetary waves, which resulted in weaker tropical stratospheric upwelling and produced anomalous warming in the tropical stratosphere. In the tropical tropopause layer (TTL), however, sublimation of ice clouds kept the temperature change minor. In the troposphere, an abrupt termination of a Madden Julian Oscillation (MJO) event occurred following the static stability increase in the TTL. This termination suggests that the stratospheric event affected the convective episode in the troposphere.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {—Trajectory similarity computation is fundamental functionality with many applications such as animal migration pattern studies and vehicle trajectory mining to identify popular routes and similar drivers. While a trajectory is a continu-ous curve in some spatial domain, e.g., 2D Euclidean space, trajectories are often represented by point sequences. Existing approaches that compute similarity based on point matching suffer from the problem that they treat two different point sequences differently even when the sequences represent the same trajectory. This is particularly a problem when the point sequences are non-uniform, have low sampling rates, and have noisy points. We propose the first deep learning approach to learning representations of trajectories that is robust to low data quality, thus supporting accurate and efficient trajectory similarity computation and search. Experiments show that our method is capable of higher accuracy and is at least one order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art methods for k-nearest trajectory search.},

abstract = {Abstract. The knowledge of surface ozone mole fractions and their global distribution is of utmost importance due to the impact of ozone on human health and ecosystems and the central role of ozone in controlling the oxidation capacity of the troposphere. The availability of long-term ozone records is far better in the Northern than in the Southern Hemisphere, and recent analyses of the seven accessible records in the Southern Hemisphere have shown inconclusive trends. Since late 1995, surface ozone is measured in situ at "El Tololo", a high-altitude (2200 m a.s.l.) and pristine station in Chile (30° S, 71° W). The dataset has been recently fully quality controlled and reprocessed. This study presents the observed ozone trends and annual cycles and identifies key processes driving these patterns. From 1995 to 2010, an overall positive trend of ∼ 0.7 ppb decade−1 is found. Strongest trends per season are observed in March and April. Highest mole fractions are observed in late spring (October) and show a strong correlation with ozone transported from the stratosphere down into the troposphere, as simulated with a model. Over the 20 years of observations, the springtime ozone maximum has shifted to earlier times in the year, which, again, is strongly correlated with a temporal shift in the occurrence of the maximum of simulated stratospheric ozone transport at the site. We conclude that background ozone at El Tololo is mainly driven by stratospheric intrusions rather than photochemical production from anthropogenic and biogenic precursors. The major footprint of the sampled air masses is located over the Pacific Ocean. Therefore, due to the negligible influence of local processes, the ozone record also allows studying the influence of El Ni{\~{n}}o and La Ni{\~{n}}a episodes on background ozone levels in South America. In agreement with previous studies, we find that, during La Ni{\~{n}}a conditions, ozone mole fractions reach higher levels than during El Ni{\~{n}}o conditions.},

abstract = {This work proposes a trajectory clustering-based approach for segmenting flow patterns in high density crowd videos. The goal is to produce a pixel-wise segmentation of a video sequence (static camera), where each segment corresponds to a different motion pattern. Unlike previous studies that use only motion vectors, we extract full trajectories so as to capture the complete temporal evolution of each region (block) in a video sequence. The extracted trajectories are dense, complex and often overlapping. A novel clustering algorithm is developed to group these trajectories that takes into account the information about the trajectories' shape, location, and the density of trajectory patterns in a spatial neighborhood. Once the trajectories are clustered, final motion segments are obtained by grouping of the resulting trajectory clusters on the basis of their area of overlap, and average flow direction. The proposed method is validated on a set of crowd videos that are commonly used in this field. On comparison with several state-of-the-art techniques, our method achieves better overall accuracy.},

We propose TrajectoryNet-a neural network architecture for point-based trajectory classification to infer real world human transportation modes from GPS traces. To overcome the challenge of capturing the underlying latent factors in the low-dimensional and heterogeneous feature space imposed by GPS data, we develop a novel representation that embeds the original feature space into another space that can be understood as a form of basis expansion. We also enrich the feature space via segment-based information and use Maxout activations to improve the predictive power of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). We achieve over 98{\%} classification accuracy when detecting four types of transportation modes, outperforming existing models without additional sensory data or location-based prior knowledge.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley  {\&}  Sons, Ltd. Trajectory clustering, which aims at discovering groups of similar trajectories, has long been considered as a corner stone task for revealing movement patterns as well as facilitating higher level applications such as location prediction and activity recognition. Although a plethora of trajectory clustering techniques have been proposed, they often rely on spatio-temporal similarity measures that are not space and time invariant. As a result, they cannot detect trajectory clusters where the within-cluster similarity occurs in different regions and time periods. In this paper, we revisit the trajectory clustering problem by learning quality low-dimensional representations of the trajectories. We first use a sliding window to extract a set of moving behaviour features that capture space- and time-invariant characteristics of the trajectories. With the feature extraction module, we transform each trajectory into a feature sequence to describe object movements and further employ a sequence-to-sequence auto-encoder to learn fixed-length deep representations. The learnt representations robustly encode the movement characteristics of the objects and thus lead to space- and time-invariant clusters. We evaluate the proposed method on both synthetic and real data and observe significant performance improvements over existing methods.},

abstract = {As precursors to tropospheric ozone and nitrate, nitrogen oxide (NO x) in the present atmosphere and its transformation in response to emission and climate perturbations are studied by using the CAM-Chem model and air quality measurements from the National Emissions Inventory (NEI), Clean Air Status and Trends Network (CASTNET), and Environmental Protection Agency Air Quality System (EPA AQS). It is found that NO x transformations in present atmospheric conditions show different sensitivities over industrial and non-industrial regions. As a result, the surface ozone and nitrate formations can be divided into several regimes associated with the dominant emission types and relative levels of NO x and volatile organic compounds (VOC). Ozone production in industrial regions (the main NO x emission source areas) increases in warmer conditions and slightly decreases following an increase in NO x emissions due to NO x titra-tion, which is opposite to the response in non-industrial regions. The ozone decrease following a temperature increase in non-industrial regions indicates that ozone production in regions that lack NO x emission sources may be sensitive to NO x transformation in remote source regions. The increase in NO 2 from NO x titration over industrial regions results in an increase rate of total nitrate that remains higher than the increase rate of NO x emissions. The presented findings indicate that a change in the ozone concentration is more directly affected by changes in climate and precursor emissions , while a change in the nitrate concentration is affected by local ozone production types and their seasonal transfer. The sensitivity to temperature perturbations shows that a warmer climate accelerates the decomposition of odd nitrogen (NO y) during the night. As a result, the transformation rate of NO x to nitrate decreases. Examinations of the historical emissions and air quality records of a typical NO x-limited area, such as Atlanta and a VOC-limited area, such as Los Angeles further confirm the conclusions drawn from the modeling experiments.},

The shape of object motion trajectory is modeled using Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), making use of both the angle attribute of the trajectory and the speed of the moving object. An unsupervised clustering algorithm, based on the Information Bottleneck (IB) method, is employed for trajectory learning to obtain an adaptive number of trajectory clusters through maximizing the Mutual Information (MI) between the clustering result and a feature set of the trajectory data. Furthermore, we propose to effectively enhance the performance of IB by taking into account the clustering quality in each iteration of the clustering procedure. The trajectories are determined as either abnormal (infrequently observed) or normal by a measure based on Shannon entropy. Extensive tests on real-world and synthetic data show that the proposed technique behaves very well and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

The winter extratropical cyclone activity in the Southern Hemisphere during the last one thousand years within a global climate simulation was analyzed by tracking cyclones, and then clustering them into ten clusters consecutively for each hundred years. There is very strong year-to-year variability for Southern Hemispheric winter extratropical cyclone numbers and larger variations on centennial time scale, more so than for its Northern Hemispherical counterparts. However, no obvious trend can be found. The mean tracks of clusters over the Southern Indian Ocean and near New Zealand shift poleward from the eleventh to the twentieth century while the clusters in the central Southern Pacific shift equatorward. Storm track clusters with largest deepening rates are found over the Southwestern Indian Ocean. In the twentieth century, rapidly deepening cyclones appear more often while long lifespan cyclones appear less frequently. The winter storm activity in the Southern Hemisphere is closely related to the Antarctic Oscillation. The cyclone frequency over the Indian Ocean and South Pacific Ocean can be associated with the Indian Ocean Dipole and El Nino-Southern Oscillation respectively.},

The equal division of tropical cyclone (TC) trajectory method, the mass moment of the TC trajectory method, and the mixed regression model method are clustering algorithms that use space and shape information from complete TC trajectories. In this article, these three clustering algorithms were applied in a TC trajectory clustering analysis to identify the TCs that affected the South China Sea (SCS) from 1949 to 2014. According to their spatial position and shape similarity, these TC trajectories were classified into five trajectory classes, including three westward straight-line movement trajectory clusters and two northward re-curving trajectory clusters. These clusters show different characteristics in their genesis position, heading, landfall location, TC intensity, lifetime and seasonality distribution. The clustering results indicate that these algorithms have different characteristics. The equal division of the trajectory method provides better clustering result generally. The approach is simple and direct, and trajectories in the same class were consistent in shape and heading. The regression mixture model algorithm has a solid theoretical mathematical foundation, and it can maintain good spatial consistency among trajectories in the class. The mass moment of the trajectory method shows overall consistency with the equal division of the trajectory method.},

abstract = {Seven years of ozone and total nitrate (the sum of gaseous HNO3 and particulate NO3-) data are analyzed to quantify the seasonal cycles of ozone production and transport in the boundary layer at 60{\o}N over the Baltic Sea. This analysis is based on the statistical correlations between ozone and total nitrate and the covariances between trace species and wind components. Ozone production efficiencies are highest near the summer solstice, decreasing to low values in March, April, and October. In winter, precursor emissions effectively deplete ozone. Horizontal average and transient fluxes of ozone and total nitrate in the boundary layer were estimated as the covariances between trace gas concentrations and horizontal wind components. A year-round northward flux of total nitrate, 2.0 m-2 1 gg(N) s-as annual average, was observed. This is the sum of a northeastward flux by the average wind field and a northwestward flux by synoptic-scale transient eddies. Embedded in an east-northeastward flux of background ozone, the sums of the components of the transient and estimated average flux divergence over Europe show large northward fluxes in summer and southward fluxes in winter. In summer, these fluxes are due to photochemically produced elevated ozone concentrations. In winter, high winds advect background ozone into the European continent which then acts as a sink area. The average effect of European precursor emissions on the horizontal flux was estimated assuming that it is the sum of the transient eddy component and the estimated average upwind divergence component over Europe. The northward component of these fluxes is higher in summer, with a highest monthly average in July of 49 gg m-2 s-1, compared to the southward fluxes in winter, with a highest value of 44 gg m-2 s-• in December, resulting in a northward yearly average flux of 6 gg m-2 s-1. The sum of the transient eddy flux component and the estimated average divergence flux component over Europe is estimated to affect monthly horizontal total ozone fluxes by 32-68{\%} in the period April-September, but only by 3-23{\%} during the winter months.},

Previous studies applied multivariate receptor models including principal components analysis and positive matrix factorization, and back trajectory receptor models including potential source contribution function, gridded frequency distributions, and concentration–back trajectory models. Combustion sources (e.g., coal combustion, biomass burning, and vehicular, industrial and waste incineration emissions), crustal/soil dust, and chemical and physical processes, such as gaseous elemental mercury (GEM) oxidation reactions, boundary layer mixing, and GEM flux from surfaces were inferred from the multivariate studies, which were predominantly conducted at receptor sites in Canada and the US. Back trajectory receptor models revealed potential impacts of large industrial areas such as the Ohio River valley in the US and throughout China, metal smelters, mercury evasion from the ocean and the Great Lakes, and free troposphere transport on receptor measurements. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} Input data and model parameters specific to atmospheric mercury receptor models are summarized and model strengths and weaknesses are also discussed. Multivariate models are suitable for receptor locations with intensive air monitoring because they require long-term collocated and simultaneous measurements of speciated atmospheric Hg and ancillary pollutants. The multivariate models provide more insight about the types of Hg emission sources and Hg processes that could affect speciated atmospheric Hg at a receptor location, whereas back trajectory receptor models are mainly ideal for identifying potential regional Hg source locations impacting elevated Hg concentrations. Interpretation of the multivariate model output to sources can be subjective and challenging when speciated atmospheric Hg is not correlated with ancillary pollutants and when source emissions profiles and knowledge of Hg chemistry are incomplete. The majority of back trajectory receptor models have not accounted for Hg transformation and deposition processes and could not distinguish between upwind and downwind sources effectively. Ensemble trajectories should be generated to take into account the trajectory uncertainties where possible. One area of improvement that applies to all the receptor models reviewed in this study is the greater focus on evaluating the accuracy of the models at identifying potential speciated atmospheric mercury sources, source locations, and chemical and physical processes in the atmosphere. In addition to receptor model improvements, the data quality of speciated atmospheric Hg plays an equally important part in producing accurate receptor model results.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Abstract. Ozone (O3) trends and variability from a 28-year (1987–2014) ozonesonde record at Lauder, New Zealand, have been analysed and interpreted using a statistical model and a global chemistry–climate model (CCM). Lauder is a clean rural measurement site often representative of the Southern Hemisphere (SH) mid-latitude background atmosphere. O3 trends over this period at this location are characterised by a significant positive trend below 6 km, a significant negative trend in the tropopause region and the lower stratosphere between 9 and 15 km, and no significant trend in the free troposphere (6–9 km) and the stratosphere above 15 km. We find that significant positive trends in lower tropospheric ozone are correlated with increasing temperature and decreasing relative humidity at the surface over this period, whereas significant negative trends in the upper troposphere and the lower stratosphere appear to be strongly linked to an upward trend of the tropopause height. Relative humidity and the tropopause height also dominate O3 variability at Lauder in the lower troposphere and the tropopause region, respectively. We perform an attribution of these trends to anthropogenic forcings including O3 precursors, greenhouse gases (GHGs), and O3-depleting substances (ODSs), using CCM simulations. Results indicate that changes in anthropogenic O3 precursors contribute significantly to stratospheric O3 reduction, changes in ODSs contribute significantly to tropospheric O3 reduction, and increased GHGs contribute significantly to stratospheric O3 increases at Lauder. Methane (CH4) likely contributes positively to O3 trends in both the troposphere and the stratosphere, but the contribution is not significant at the 95 {\%} confidence level over this period. An extended analysis of CCM results covering 1960–2010 (i.e. starting well before the observations) reveals significant contributions from all forcings to O3 trends at Lauder – i.e. increases in GHGs and the increase in CH4 alone all contribute significantly to O3 increases, net increases in ODSs lead to O3 reduction, and increases in non-methane O3 precursors cause O3 increases in the troposphere and reductions in the stratosphere. This study suggests that a long-term ozonesonde record obtained at a SH mid-latitude background site (corroborated by a surface O3 record at a nearby SH mid-latitude site, Baring Head, which also shows a significant positive trend) is a useful indicator for detecting atmospheric composition and climate change associated with human activities.},

The five patterns have been named according to their most important features as follows: low over the Weddell Sea (LWS), low over the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas (LAB), low over the Drake Passage (LDP), zonal flow over the Drake Passage (ZDP), and ridge over the Antarctic Peninsula (RAP). Each atmospheric pattern is described after analyzing its development and evolution. A frequency analysis shows that the five atmospheric patterns present a similar annual frequency but a large seasonal variability.

abstract = {Massive trajectory data generated by ubiquitous position acquisition technology are valuable for knowledge discovery. The study of trajectory mining that converts knowledge into decision support becomes appealing. Mobility modes awareness is one of the most important aspects of trajectory mining. It contributes to land use planning, intelligent transportation, anomaly events prevention, etc. To achieve better comprehension of mobility modes, we propose a method to integrate the issues of mobility modes discovery and mobility modes identification together. Firstly, route patterns of trajectories were mined based on unsupervised origin and destination (OD) points clustering. After the combination of route patterns and travel activity information, different mobility modes existing in history trajectories were discovered. Then a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based method was proposed to identify the mobility modes of newly emerging trajectories. The labeled history trajectory data were utilized to train the identification model. Moreover, in this approach, we introduced a mobility-based trajectory structure as the input of the identification model. This method was evaluated with a real-world maritime trajectory dataset. The experiment results indicated the excellence of this method. The mobility modes discovered by our method were clearly distinguishable from each other and the identification accuracy was higher compared with other techniques.},

abstract = {The main purpose of this paper is to contribute to the improvement in the present knowledge concerning regional carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) exchange as an essential step towards reducing the uncertainties along with bottom-up estimations of their global budget by identifying the characteristic spatial and temporal scales of the regional greenhouse gas fluxes. To this end, we propose a stepwise statistical top-down methodology for examining the relationship between synoptic-scale atmospheric transport patterns and mole fractions of the climate gases to finally receive a characterisation of the sampling sites with regard to the key processes driving the CO2 or CH4 concentration levels. The results of this study presented in this paper give detailed insights into the emission structures underlying the measurement time series by means of origin-related examinations of the Alpine CO2 and CH4 budgets. The time series of both climate gases from the atmospheric measurements carried out at the four high-alpine observatories Schneefernerhaus, Jungfraujoch, Sonnblick and Plateau Rosa form the basis for the characterisation of the regional CO2 as well as CH4 budget of the Alpine region as the focus area of the Central European study region. For the investigation area so outlined, the project identifies source and relative sink regions with influence on the Alpine climate gas measurements as well as their temporal variations. The therefore required combination of the measurements with the synoptic situation prevailing at the respective measuring time which carries the information about the origin of the analysed air masses is derived by means of a trajectory-based receptor model. The back trajectory receptor model is set up to decipher with high spatial resolution the most relevant source and sink areas, whereby the Alpine region is identified as a significant relative sink for CO2 as well as for CH4 concentrations all year long, whereas major European emitters show their impact during different seasons. The reliable results achieved with this approach in connection with the encouraging model-internal uncertainty assessments and external plausibility checks lend credence to our model and its strength to illustrate dependably spatial–temporal variations of the relevant emitters and absorbers of different climate gases (CO2 and CH4) in high spatial resolution.},

@article{Zatko2016a,
abstract = {Abstract. The formation and recycling of reactive nitrogen (NO, NO2, HONO) at the air–snow interface has implications for air quality and the oxidation capacity of the atmosphere in snow-covered regions. Nitrate (NO3−) photolysis in snow provides a source of oxidants (e.g., hydroxyl radical) and oxidant precursors (e.g., nitrogen oxides) to the overlying boundary layer, and alters the concentration and isotopic (e.g., $\delta$15N) signature of NO3− preserved in ice cores. We have incorporated an idealized snowpack with a NO3− photolysis parameterization into a global chemical transport model (Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) Chemistry model, GEOS-Chem) to examine the implications of snow NO3− photolysis for boundary layer chemistry, the recycling and redistribution of reactive nitrogen, and the preservation of ice-core NO3− in ice cores across Antarctica and Greenland, where observations of these parameters over large spatial scales are difficult to obtain. A major goal of this study is to examine the influence of meteorological parameters and chemical, optical, and physical snow properties on the magnitudes and spatial patterns of snow-sourced NOx fluxes and the recycling and redistribution of reactive nitrogen across Antarctica and Greenland. Snow-sourced NOx fluxes are most influenced by temperature-dependent quantum yields of NO3− photolysis, photolabile NO3− concentrations in snow, and concentrations of light-absorbing impurities (LAIs) in snow. Despite very different assumptions about snowpack properties, the range of model-calculated snow-sourced NOx fluxes are similar in Greenland (0.5–11 × 108 molec cm−2 s−1) and Antarctica (0.01–6.4 × 108 molec cm−2 s−1) due to the opposing effects of higher concentrations of both photolabile NO3− and LAIs in Greenland compared to Antarctica. Despite the similarity in snow-sourced NOx fluxes, these fluxes lead to smaller factor increases in mean austral summer boundary layer mixing ratios of total nitrate (HNO3+ NO3−), NOx, OH, and O3 in Greenland compared to Antarctica because of Greenland's proximity to pollution sources. The degree of nitrogen recycling in the snow is dependent on the relative magnitudes of snow-sourced NOx fluxes versus primary NO3− deposition. Recycling of snow NO3− in Greenland is much less than in Antarctica Photolysis-driven loss of snow NO3− is largely dependent on the time that NO3− remains in the snow photic zone (up to 6.5 years in Antarctica and 7 months in Greenland), and wind patterns that redistribute snow-sourced reactive nitrogen across Antarctica and Greenland. The loss of snow NO3− is higher in Antarctica (up to 99 {\%}) than in Greenland (up to 83 {\%}) due to deeper snow photic zones and lower snow accumulation rates in Antarctica. Modeled enrichments in ice-core $\delta$15N(NO3−) due to photolysis-driven loss of snow NO3− ranges from 0 to 363 ‰ in Antarctica and 0 to 90 ‰ in Greenland, with the highest fraction of NO3− loss and largest enrichments in ice-core $\delta$15N(NO3−) at high elevations where snow accumulation rates are lowest. There is a strong relationship between the degree of photolysis-driven loss of snow NO3− and the degree of nitrogen recycling between the air and snow throughout all of Greenland and in Antarctica where snow accumulation rates are greater than 130 kg m−2 a−1 in the present day.},

abstract = {A probabilistic clustering technique is developed for classification of wintertime extratropical cyclone (ETC) tracks over the North Atlantic. We use a regression mixture model to describe the longitude-time and latitude-time propagation of the ETCs. A simple tracking algorithm is applied to 6-hourly mean sea-level pressure fields to obtain the tracks from either a general circulation model (GCM) or a reanalysis data set. Quadratic curves are found to provide the best description of the data. We select a three-cluster classification for both data sets, based on a mix of objective and subjective criteria. The track orientations in each of the clusters are broadly similar for the GCM and reanalyzed data; they are characterized by predominantly south-to-north (S-N), west-to-east (W-E), and southwest-to-northeast (SW-NE) tracking cyclones, respectively. The reanalysis cyclone tracks, however, are found to be much more tightly clustered geographically than those of the GCM. For the reanalysis data, a link is found between the occurrence of cyclones belonging to different clusters of trajectory-shape, and the phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The positive phase of the NAO is associated with the SW-NE oriented cluster, whose tracks are relatively straight and smooth (with cyclones that are typically faster, more intense, and of longer duration). The negative NAO phase is associated with more-erratic W-E tracks, with typically weaker and slower-moving cyclones. The S-N cluster is accompanied by a more transient geopotential trough over the western North Atlantic. No clear associations are found in the case of the GCM composites. The GCM is able to capture cyclone tracks of quite realistic orientation, as well as subtle  associated features of cyclone intensity, speed and lifetimes. The clustering clearly highlights, though, the presence of serious systematic errors in the GCM's simulation of ETC behavior. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag 2007.},

abstract = {Stratospheric final warming (SFW) in the Southern Hemisphere is examined in terms of their interannual variability and climatology using reanalysis data from January 1979 to March 2014. First, it is shown from a two-dimensional transformed Eulerian mean (TEM) analysis that a time-integrated vertical component of Eliassen-Palm flux during the spring is significantly related with SFW date. To clarify the role of residual mean flow in the interannual variability of the SFW date, SFWs are categorized into early and late groups according to the SFW date and their differences are examined. Significant difference in potential temperature tendency is observed in the middle and lower stratosphere in early October. Their structure in the meridional cross section accords well with that of vertical potential temperature advection by the residual mean flow. Difference in heating rate by shortwave radiation is minor. These results suggest that the adiabatic heating associated with the residual mean flow largely affects polar stratospheric temperature during austral spring and SFW date. The analysis is extended to investigate the longitudinal structure by using a three-dimensional (3-D) TEM theory. The significant difference in potential temperature tendency is mainly observed around the Weddell Sea at 10 hPa. Next, climatological 3-D structure of a vertical component of the residual mean flow in association with SFW is examined in terms of the effect on the troposphere. The results suggest that a downward residual mean flow from the stratosphere penetrates into underlying troposphere over East Antarctica and partly influences tropospheric temperature there. 1.},

abstract = {Synoptic classifications over the Southern Ocean in the Ross Sea region of Antarctica (508S-Antarctic coast, 1508E-908W) have been derived from NCEP reanalysis data (1979-2011), producing a set of six synoptic types for the region. These types describe realistic synoptic conditions for the region and represent the moisture-bearing low pressure systems that circulate around Antarctica. The types are described as follows: low Bellingshausen/Amundsen (L-BA), low (L), zonal (Z), low Ross (L-R), ridge (R), and low Amundsen (L-A). Seasonal frequencies of the synoptic types reflect the seasonal zonal shift of the Amundsen Sea low (ASL) and also correlate well with the Southern Oscillation index (SOI) and the southern annular mode (SAM). Variability in the occurrences of the synoptic types L-R and L-BA indicate a shifting of the position of the ASL farther east (west) toward (away from) the Antarctic Peninsula during La Ni{\~{n}} a (El Ni{\~{n}} o) and positive (negative) SAM conditions. A joint linear regression of the SOI and SAM indices show the strongest correlations with the types L-BA and L-R in the spring and quantifies the joint forcing effect of these climate cycles on synoptic variability in the region. As a demonstration of how synoptic classification provides links between large-scale atmospheric circulation and local climate parameters, the synoptic types are related to precipitation and temperature at Roosevelt Island, an ice core site on the Ross Ice Shelf (808S, 1608W). The synoptic types provide quantifi-cation of distinct precipitation and temperature regimes at this site, which allows for more fundamental understanding of the precipitation source regions and transport pathways that drive the variability in snow and ice proxies.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2000-2011 IEEE. Clustering of large-scale vehicle trajectories is an important aspect for understanding urban traffic patterns, particularly for optimizing public transport routes and frequencies and improving the decisions made by authorities. Existing trajectory clustering schemes are not well suited to large numbers of trajectories in dense city road networks due to the difficulty in finding a representative distance measure between trajectories that can scale to very large datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel Dijkstra-based dynamic time warping distance measure, trajDTW between two trajectories, which is suitable for large numbers of overlapping trajectories in a dense road network as found in major cities around the world. We also propose a novel fast-clusiVAT algorithm that can suggest the number of clusters in a trajectory dataset and identify and visualize the trajectories belonging to each cluster. We conduct experiments on a large-scale taxi trajectory dataset consisting of 3.28 million trajectories obtained from the GPS traces of 15 061 taxis within Singapore over a period of one month. Our analysis finds 13 trajectory clusters spanning the major expressways of Singapore, each of which can be further divided into two sub-clusters based on the travel direction. For each cluster, we provide a time-based distribution of trajectories to yield insights into how urban mobility patterns change with the time of day. We compare the trajectory clusters obtained using our approach with those obtained using popular general and trajectory specific clustering frameworks: DBSCAN, OPTICS, NETSCAN, and NEAT. We demonstrate that the clusters obtained using our novel fast-clusiVAT framework are better than those obtained using other clustering schemes, evaluated based on two internal cluster validity measures: Dunn's and Silhouette indices. Moreover, our fast-clusiVAT algorithm achieves significant speedup over a comparable approach without loss of cluster quality.},

Global and regional trends in tropopause characteristics for annual and solsticial seasonal means are presented here, with emphasis on significant results for the newer ERA-Interim data for 1989-2007. The global-mean tropopause is rising at a rate of 47 m per decade, with pressure falling at 1.0 hPa per decade and temperature falling at 0.18 K per decade. The Antarctic tropopause shows decreasing heights, warming and increasing westerly winds. The Arctic tropopause also shows a warming, but with decreasing westerly winds. In the Tropics the trends are small, but at the latitudes of the subtropical jets they are almost double the global values. It is found that these changes are mainly concentrated in the eastern hemisphere. Previous and new metrics for the rate of broadening of the Tropics, based on both height and wind, give trends in the range 0.9-2.2 • per decade. For ERA-40 the global height and pressure trends for the period 1979-2001 are similar: 39 m per decade and −0.8 hPa per decade.

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 A {\&} WMA. Efforts have been made to relate measured concentrations of airborne constituents to their origins for more than 50 years. During this time interval, there have been developments in the measurement technology to gather highly time-resolved, detailed chemical compositional data. Similarly, the improvements in computers have permitted a parallel development of data analysis tools that permit the extraction of information from these data. There is now a substantial capability to provide useful insights into the sources of pollutants and their atmospheric processing that can help inform air quality management options. Efforts have been made to combine receptor and chemical transport models to provide improved apportionments. Tools are available to utilize limited numbers of known profiles with the ambient data to obtain more accurate apportionments for targeted sources. In addition, tools are in place to allow more advanced models to be fitted to the data based on conceptual models of the nature of the sources and the sampling/analytical approach. Each of the approaches has its strengths and weaknesses. However, the field as a whole suffers from a lack of measurements of source emission compositions. There has not been an active effort to develop source profiles for stationary sources for a long time, and with many significant sources built in developing countries, the lack of local profiles is a serious problem in effective source apportionment. The field is now relatively mature in terms of its methods and its ability to adapt to new measurement technologies, so that we can be assured of a high likelihood of extracting the maximal information from the collected data. Implications: Efforts have been made over the past 50 years to use air quality data to estimate the influence of air pollution sources. These methods are now relatively mature and many are readily accessible through publically available software. This review examines the development of receptor models and the current state of the art in extracting source identification and apportionments from ambient air quality data.},

The success of Deep Learning models, notably convolutional neural networks (CNNs), makes them the favorable solution for object recognition systems in both visible and infrared domains. However, the lack of training data in the case of maritime ships research leads to poor performance due to the problem of overfitting. In addition, the back-propagation algorithm used to train CNN is very slow and requires tuning many hyperparameters. To overcome these weaknesses, we introduce a new approach fully based on Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to learn useful CNN features and perform a fast and accurate classification, which is suitable for infrared-based recognition systems. The proposed approach combines an ELM based learning algorithm to train CNN for discriminative features extraction and an ELM based ensemble for classification. The experimental results on VAIS dataset, which is the largest dataset of maritime ships, confirm that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art models in term of generalization performance and training speed. For instance, the proposed model is up to 950 times faster than the traditional back-propagation based training of convolutional neural networks, primarily for low-level features extraction.},

abstract = {With the development of GPS-enabled devices, wireless communication and storage technologies, trajectories representing the mobility of moving objects are accumulated at an unprecedented pace. They contain a large amount of temporal and spatial semantic information. A great deal of valuable information can be obtained by mining and analyzing the trajectory dataset. Trajectory clustering is one of the simplest and most powerful methods to obtain knowledge from trajectory data, which is based on the similarity measure between trajectories. The existing similarity measurement methods cannot fully utilize the specific features of trajectory itself when measuring the distance between trajectories. In this paper, an enhanced trajectory model is proposed and a new trajectory clustering algorithm is presented based on multi-feature trajectory similarity measure, which can maximize the similarity of trajectories in the same cluster, and can be used to better serve for applications including traffic monitoring and road congestion prediction. Both the intuitive visualization presentation and the experimental results on synthetic and real trajectory datasets show that, compared to existing methods, the proposed approach improves the accuracy and efficiency of trajectory clustering.},

@article{Cristofanelli2018,
abstract = {This work focuses on the near-surface O3 variability over the eastern Antarctic Plateau. In particular, eight years (2006–2013) of continuous observations at the WMO/GAW contributing station “Concordia” (Dome C–DMC: 75°06′S, 123°20′E, 3280 m) are presented, in the framework of the Italian Antarctic Research Programme (PNRA). First, the characterization of seasonal and diurnal O3 variability at DMC is provided. Then, for the period of highest data coverage (2008–2013), we investigated the role of specific atmospheric processes in affecting near-surface summer O3 variability, when O3 enhancement events (OEEs) are systematically observed at DMC (average monthly frequency peaking up to 60{\%} in December). As deduced by a statistical selection methodology, these OEEs are affected by a significant interannual variability, both in their average O3 values and in their frequency. To explain part of this variability, we analyzed OEEs as a function of specific atmospheric variables and processes: (i) total column of O3 (TCO) and UV-A irradiance, (ii) long-range transport of air masses over the Antarctic Plateau (by Lagrangian back-trajectory analysis – LAGRANTO), (iii) occurrence of “deep” stratospheric intrusion events (by using the Lagrangian tool STLEFLUX). The overall near-surface O3 variability at DMC is controlled by a day-to-day pattern, which strongly points towards a dominating influence of processes occurring at “synoptic” scales rather than “local” processes. Even if previous studies suggested an inverse relationship between OEEs and TCO, we found a slight tendency for the annual frequency of OEEs to be higher when TCO values are higher over DMC. The annual occurrence of OEEs at DMC seems related to the total time spent by air masses over the Antarctic plateau before their arrival to DMC, suggesting the accumulation of photochemically-produced O3 during the transport, rather than a more efficient local production. Moreover, the identification of recent (i.e., 4-day old) stratospheric intrusion events by STEFLUX suggested only a minor influence (up to 3{\%} of the period, in November) of “deep” events on the variability of near-surface summer O3 at DMC.},

abstract = {Gaseous oxidized mercury (GOM) and particle-bound mercury (PBM) measurement uncertainties could potentially affect the analysis and modeling of atmospheric mercury. This study investigated the impact of GOM measurement uncertainties on Principal Components Analysis (PCA), Absolute Principal Component Scores (APCS), and Concentration-Weighted Trajectory (CWT) receptor modeling results. The atmospheric mercury data input into these receptor models were modified by combining GOM and PBM into a single reactive mercury (RM) parameter and excluding low GOM measurements to improve the data quality. PCA and APCS results derived from RM or excluding low GOM measurements were similar to those in previous studies, except for a non-unique component and an additional component extracted from the RM dataset. The percent variance explained by the major components from a previous study differed slightly compared to RM and excluding low GOM measurements. CWT results were more sensitive to the input of RM than GOM excluding low measurements. Larger discrepancies were found between RM and GOM source regions than those between RM and PBM. Depending on the season, CWT source regions of RM differed by 40-61{\%} compared to GOM from a previous study. No improvement in correlations between CWT results and anthropogenic mercury emissions were found. {\textcopyright} 2016, Nature Publishing Group. All rights reserved.},

@article{Han2018,
abstract = {In this study, we characterize the transport of ozone from Africa to Asia through the analysis of the simulations of a global chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem, from 1987 to 2006. The receptor region Asia is defined within 5–60° N and 60–145° E, while the source region Africa is within 35° S–15° N and 20° W–55° E and within 15–35° N and 20° W–30° E. The ozone generated in the African troposphere from both natural and anthropogenic sources is tracked through tagged ozone simulation. Combining this with analysis of trajectory simulations using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model, we find that the upper branch of the Hadley cell connects with the subtropical westerlies in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) to form a primary transport pathway from Africa to Asia in the middle and upper troposphere throughout the year. The Somali jet that runs from eastern Africa near the equator to the Indian subcontinent in the lower troposphere is the second pathway that appears only in NH summer. The influence of African ozone mainly appears over Asia south of 40° N. The influence shows strong seasonality, varying with latitude, longitude, and altitude. In the Asian upper troposphere, imported African ozone is largest from March to May around 30° N (12–16 ppbv) and lowest during July–October around 10° N ( ∼ 2 ppbv). In the Asian middle and lower troposphere, imported African ozone peaks in NH winter between 20 and 25° N. Over 5–40° N, the mean fractional contribution of imported African ozone to the overall ozone concentrations in Asia is largest during NH winter in the middle troposphere ( ∼ 18 {\%}) and lowest in NH summer throughout the tropospheric column ( ∼ 6 {\%}). This seasonality mainly results from the collective effects of the ozone precursor emissions in Africa and meteorology and chemistry in Africa, in Asia and along the transport pathways. The seasonal swing of the Hadley circulation and subtropical westerlies along the primary transport pathway plays a dominant role in modulating the seasonality. There is more imported African ozone in the Asian upper troposphere in NH spring than in winter. This is likely due to more ozone in the NH African upper troposphere generated from biogenic and lightning NOx emissions in NH spring. The influence of African ozone on Asia appears larger in NH spring than in autumn. This can be attributed to both higher altitudes of the elevated ozone in Africa and stronger subtropical westerlies in NH spring. In NH summer, African ozone hardly reaches Asia because of the blocking by the Saharan High, Arabian High, and Tibetan High on the transport pathway in the middle and upper troposphere, in addition to the northward swing of the subtropical westerlies. The seasonal swings of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) in Africa, coinciding with the geographic variations of the ozone precursor emissions, can further modulate the seasonality of the transport of African ozone, owing to the functions of the ITCZ in enhancing lightning NOx generation and uplifting ozone and ozone precursors to upper layers. The strength of the ITCZ in Africa is also found to be positively correlated with the interannual variation of the transport of African ozone to Asia in NH winter. Ozone from NH Africa makes up over 80 {\%} of the total imported African ozone over Asia in most altitudes and seasons. The interhemispheric transport of ozone from southern hemispheric Africa (SHAF) is most evident in NH winter over the Asian upper troposphere and in NH summer over the Asian lower troposphere. The former case is associated with the primary transport pathway in NH winter, while the latter case is associated with the second transport pathway. The intensities of the ITCZ in Africa and the Somali jet can each explain ∼ 30 {\%} of the interannual variations in the transport of ozone from SHAF to Asia in the two cases.},
